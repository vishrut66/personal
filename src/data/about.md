# Some history

- My history is quite normal.

- The story begins with completing grade ten and deciding to pursue a three-year diploma course in automobile engineering. However, after two years of studying, I realized that this course was not the right fit for me, but I still decided to complete the program.

- After completing the diploma course, I took a year off to contemplate my future career options. During this time, I likely evaluated my interests, skills, and values to determine the direction I wanted to take.

- Eventually, I became interested in technology and programming and started learning the basics, then my knowledge and skills in technology led me to the IT field.

- that's it.
